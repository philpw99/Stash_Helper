# Stash_Helper
<a href='https://github.com/stashapp/stash'>StashApp</a> is a powerful content management program for your porn collections. It's cross-platform and comes with many website scrapers. It will make your whole video collection looks professional: with detail info about scenes, performers, studios...etc. It's like what Plex has done for your movie collections.<br>
Though Stash is powerful. It comes with just a console window and not super easy to use for the beginners. This program is trying to improve that aspect and add some features to it.
## Installation
Get the latest release <a href='https://github.com/philpw99/Stash_Helper/releases'>here</a> and just run it. Basically the installer has nothing need to change.
