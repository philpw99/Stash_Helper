# Stash_Helper
<a href='https://github.com/stashapp/stash'>StashApp</a> is a powerful content management program for your porn collections. It's cross-platform and comes with many website scrapers. It will make your whole video collection looks professional: with detail info about scenes, performers, studios...etc. It's like what Plex has done for your movie collections.<br>
Though Stash is powerful. It comes with just a console window and not super easy to use for the beginners. This program is trying to improve that aspect and add some features to it.
## Installation
Get the latest release <a href='https://github.com/philpw99/Stash_Helper/releases'>here</a> and just run it. Basically the installer has nothing need to change.

## Running it the first time
After installation now you have this item in your start menu:<p>
<img src='https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/22040708/138208688-82c2f177-7fc7-4741-bd52-55968f7912c7.png' width=200><br>
Click on it, and this welcome screen will show up:<p>
<img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/22040708/138208905-0866b161-55f1-407d-89e8-3a17a6e9156d.png" width=500><p>
Now it's time to browse for that stash-win.exe you downloaded from the "Stash" link above. Or you can click on the "Website" button and go there.<p><p>
The second question is about which browser you want to use to see the content provided by Stash. I recommend Chrome and Edge. Firefox will give you a robot head and a red address bar. Doesn't look good that way.<p>
<img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/22040708/138209311-6d4f61c7-6b8e-4112-ae99-7dc9bd2f436c.png" width=500><p><p>
Then it's all set. There are some extra info I provided for the first time Stash user, and you will see why you need to know them later. Right now just **launch it** already!<p>

Now you should comes to the Stash Wizard screen:<br>
<img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/22040708/138209968-8dace6ce-efff-4a43-96a6-ee973c2dfc6c.png" width=500> <p><p>
Complicated? Hard to understand? Don't be. Just click on "In the current working directory". That's the correct answer 99.9999% of the time.<p><p>
  
The next screen seems less intimidating, just click on the "Add Directory" button, tell Stash where your carefully curated collections are. Then click on "Next"<br>
<img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/22040708/138210908-61981efa-7751-49b1-b94d-68cc160adf6c.png" width=500> <p><p>

This screen is even easier, just click on "Confirm"<br>
<img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/22040708/138211131-46199e20-7844-4831-9fb2-645de597f1a5.png" width=300><p><p>

Once again, it says blah,blah,blah and your instinct is to click on "Finish", right?
<img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/22040708/138211507-2c33a8b5-0656-4ac1-82b0-588f70af59d0.png" width=500><p>
**WRONG** Notice it tells that you need to "...clicking on Tasks, then Scan..."??? Yeah, I did miss that part, and it took me quite a while to figure it out.<p><p>
  
Now you are staring at an empty Stash database and still don't know what went wrong. Didn't you just tell Stash where your em... collections were?<p>
<img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/22040708/138212537-cbfc874e-c445-493c-90f5-18802c22173c.png" width=500> <p><p>
No, this is actually your fault. You need to follow the instructions. Go to the "Settings", click on "Task" then "Scan", like the screen shown here.<p>
<img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/22040708/138212569-5374e995-1e7a-4fd3-9573-3eadf5d81efc.png" width=500><p><p>
Then just like magic, all your video collections are now showing up in the "Scenes","images" and "Galleries"(if you have zipped jpgs).<p>
Because those screens are not "Work Place Safe". So I won't show them here. Just want to congratulate you on your first baby step toward the almighty Stash !
And where is my program fit in? It's hiding in the corner! Look here:<p>
<img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/22040708/138213174-2e4a4500-847d-4304-b55f-5f77272709d0.png"><p>
It's ready to help. Click on it and you will see:<p>
<img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/22040708/138213370-85e18ad5-6da4-424b-8142-226f51c8c4e8.png"><p><p>

So what's so special about it? Well, go to the settings, please.<p>
<img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/22040708/138213609-85376330-1d3f-4a7e-a45c-121d54e424d3.png" width=500><p>
You see? Besides you can use your own media player to play your scenes, there is a "Boss Coming Key" for you, in case your boss is really coming toward you at the worst moment. :D <p>
Now the most powerful feature is customizing the menu. Click on "Scenes->Customize...", and you will see this:<p>
<img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/22040708/138214537-3fca6801-4e2d-4200-aad3-eaee459f19aa.png" width=500><p><p>
This is like the bookmark or favorite list. You can give it an descriptive title, then paste the link copied from Stash, like I've shown above.
Next time you can get to the same page easily by using my helper:<p>
<img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/22040708/138214850-b83c685c-e3bb-40a1-8caf-8656720a39a0.png" width=500> <p><p>
  
The next topic is about "Scraper Manager". This is a very important feature in both Stash and my helper.<p>
<img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/22040708/138215264-a1f85586-1ae3-4235-8443-29ef5da78ded.png" width=500><p><p>
If you know the website where your downloaded your video, a scraper will help you to retrieve the video information by "scraping" that video's URL.<br>
A scraper will save you tons of time. You don't need to manually type in things like performers, studio, production date, description, video duration...etc. A scraper get those information for you, but you need to know **which** scraper to get. Some scrapers get you great accurate info, some don't. So you need to do the experiments for them. Since I provide you an easy way to install/remove scrapers, it should be a piece of cake.<p>
To use an installed scraper, you choose a scene, click on "Edit" and fill in the "URL" blanket. If that URL fits the scraper's website, an white scraper icon will come up next to URL. Click on that and the scraper will start its work.<p>
Some scrapers don't need URLs, like Performer's scrapers. They just need a name, and they will search a website for that name, and give you the performer's info in return.<p>
One more thing, why Stash has "Movies" that people rarely used? Well, movies are used for Japanese videos, in which one movies usually contains multiple scenes. There is nothing wrong to create a movie for a single-scene video. The movies have front and back cover, and they look really cool on my screen.<p><p><p>

Well, I guess this concludes the readme. There will be more features coming, both in Stash and my little helper. I hope you will find "pleasure" in using them. :D
